<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Frank E. Young Jr. (Nooney) 
  </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Frank E. Young Jr. had no 
  idea that one day when he embarked on a trail ride for fun that he would have 
  an epiphany ... to learn to play the accordion! Listening to the group Zydeco 
  Force during that trail ride, he became so engulfed in Zydeco music that his 
  passion to play resulted in him being transformed several years later into the 
  man in demand to bring audiences to their feet as ... Nooney and the Zydeco 
  Floaters! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Affectionately nick named 
  "Nooney" as a toddler by his mother, this Houston native grew up in an area 
  known as Fidelity with his greatest wealth being strong community ties. A natural 
  athlete due to his father Frank E. Young Sr. being a renowned Welterweight champion, 
  Nooney participated in all sports while at Galena Park High and really had no 
  interest in music other than listening to it. During those years he jammed to 
  a little R&B and rap with Maze, The Isley Brothers, LL Cool J and Ice Cube topping 
  as his favorite artists. As an urban cowboy he developed a love for country 
  music with his favorites being Garth Brooks and George Strait. Little did he 
  know that one day that eclectic array of musical artists would further influence 
  the course of his life and career. He played his first gig at his own birthday 
  party held at the Tabassco Club and the response was overwhelming even though 
  the band only knew fourteen songs. The experience was so gratifying it inspired 
  him to go further to bring his dream into a reality ... to seek engagements 
  and to eventually record! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He did just that under his 
  own independent label Thai's Who We Be Records which was also the title of his 
  first CD That's Who We Be released in 1998. In the year 2000 he released his 
  second CD entitled Bringin The Dream and his newly released CD is entitled Bringin 
  The Hear which reinforces his goal that Zydeco is a musical force to be reckoned 
  with! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nooney's creative musical 
  blend of licks and lyrics have thought provoking purpose ... to make Zydeco 
  an aspiring genre to be resilient, recognized, and respected He wants that acknowledgement 
  for what he calls old school Zydeco by the greats such as the late Beau Jacque 
  and Rocking Sidney but mainly for its genesis to date that he helped to create 
  under the mentorship of Jeffrey Broussard and Step Rideau! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nooney's blend of R&B, with 
  a slash of soul and a dash of Creole/Cajun seasoning combined with inventive 
  choreographed steps implode to phenomenal heights of originality for a new wave 
  Zydeco ... Nooney style! It's Zydeco zeal in a highly energetic show that always 
  ignites a crowd and these accordion architects of sound can build monumental 
  excitement! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nooney had no idea ... then... 
  but today this courageous young man is on a mission and he has plenty of ideas! 
  Just take a listen 'cause he is and will always be bringing the heat! </font></p>
