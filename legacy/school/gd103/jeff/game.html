        <p><b>Gorillaz Game Concept</b><br></div>
           
      <div align="left">Game Name: Gorillaz 
        <p>Platform: Playstation 2 </p>
        <p>Story Line: The four members of the Gorillaz rock group have come across 
          a problem. An evil mechanical ape named "Osmos" has a plot to take over 
          the world with his evil army of "mecha-apes." However, only the Gorillaz 
          group has knowledge of this evil plot due to the fact that Osmos has 
          cleverly kept his intentions secret. The Gorillaz had known Osmos from 
          years before and fell suspicious after peculiar actions that Osmos was 
          making. Osmos' Plan: Take over the world one continent at a time through 
          means of military use of his massing army of mecha-apes. </p>
        <p>Goal of Game: To Stop Osmos by use of the four members of the group 
          Gorillaz and their individual special skills. The Gorillaz must respond 
          to a series of attacks being conducted on the seven continents of the 
          world. </p>
        <p>Character Skills: Each member of the Gorillaz has strengths and weaknesses 
          in their skills in certain aspects of their need to participate in stopping 
          Osmos and his evil army. Each member will have different weapons and 
          vehicles for the level of each continent. Continents/Levels- </p>
        <p>Antarctica: Osmos has established a hidden base in the vast ocean of 
          ice in Antarctica. Your job is to work your way across the continent 
          in order to find and destroy the hidden base through use of military 
          modified snowmobiles, Snow-Cats, and other snow-based vehicles. </p>
        <p>Africa: Osmos has lead you into a trap in which the Gorillaz must get 
          out of and find a weapon that will help in destroying Osmos later on. 
          Your responsibility is to move through a series of mazes in ancient 
          Egypt as well as desert caverns destroying mecha-apes as they try to 
          stop your progress. </p>
        <p>South America: In the Jungles of South America you must stop the destruction 
          of forests and stop the spread of Osmos army on local villages through 
          the use of weaponry and other equipment that you may have picked up 
          along the way in other continents. </p>
        <p>Australia: Osmos has a secret factory that is producing massive amounts 
          of mecha-apes located under the water in the Great Barrier Reef. Your 
          job will be to find your way through the underwater mazes by use of 
          a select variety of submersive vehicles. </p>
        <p>Europe: Osmos has control over the continent through use of a secret 
          weapon similar to a powerful laser that can kill a person with little 
          effort or resistance. You must sneak into the compound where this weapon 
          and smaller versions of this weapon are being held. You must sneak up 
          on mecha-apes without being seen and destroy them before they destroy 
          you. </p>
        <p>Asia: The governments of Asia have no idea that Osmos has migrated 
          himself to their and has taken refuge in one of the major cities on 
          the Pacific Rim. You must find Osmos through a series of clues he has 
          left in several large cities such as Tokyo, Hong Kong, ect… be prepared 
          for several shootouts in the streets of these cities with mecha-ape 
          assassins. You will meet Osmos and oust him from the area. Then pursue 
          him to the final continent North America. </p>
        <p>North America: Osmos has fled Asia, but is trying to get away in his 
          supersonic fighter jet. You must seek and destroy him in your own Gorillaz 
          Jet. Along your pursuit destroy as many Mecha-ape fighters you can to 
          ensure an easier aerial fight against Osmos. Prologue: The Gorillaz 
          have defeated Osmos and have been given the attention of the world. 
          Then return home to continue their dream of playing their music. </p>
