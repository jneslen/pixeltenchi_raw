<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1998 I, along with a friend started a company that was
going to be a web based company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
name of the company was ISP International, ISP an acronym for International
Study Program.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company was based
upon the need that Japanese students had for homestay families while attending
College in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My friend had moved to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to be in charge of setting up an office for processing new applicants and a
sort of escort for travel arrangements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I on the other hand was to be head of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
office and in charge of several areas, including the following;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Initial Web Planning<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>At the time the
internet was still at the peak of profitability and the best place to stir up
international interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I along with the
help of my partner began the initial planning and design of the web site <a
href="http://www.ispint.com/">www.ispint.com</a>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was to be used to mainly promote homestay
packages for international students who wanted to come to <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for college or to learn English.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Secondary the site was to be used to collect and recruit host families
that lived in the <st1:State><st1:place>Utah</st1:place></st1:State> area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Web Marketing Process<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We began development of the site with a design that would
only include promotion and basically a free place for people to come and meet
others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With careful design of content
and Meta Tag use we began to submit the site to major search engines through
several techniques and different types of software, Web Position Gold being one
of those applications.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Funds were set
aside for advertising and submission to the major search engines including
Yahoo and Excite (at the time Excite was still a major search engine
site).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition we began to seek out
English related sites and began to promote through the use of Yahoo clubs (now <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/">groups.yahoo.com</a>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were listed fairly fast with several of
the search engines and linked by several major English learning websites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The main point of our now growing free site was a type of
pen pal page for people from all over the world to come and post messages to
meet new people from other countries (mostly English and Japanese Speaking,
since the site was in Japanese and English).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As a side promotion we used this new found popularity to show off the
major announcement of a Homestay program “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coming
soon</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We promoted in this style for approximately 3 months, during
which time we collected names and e-mail contacts under a statistical and
logistical plan, such as age groups, location and the interest to learn
English.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After three months we had tens
of thousands of posts and traffic of approximately 10,000 unique hits per day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Candidates that fit a specific detail were e-mailed and
promoted too further urging them to participate in a trial period homestay in
which they only had to pay for travel expense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>“Imagine learning
English and experiencing how Americans live by staying with a homestay family
in the </i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United
  States</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All for the price of your
Airfare alone!”<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This promotion was very successful and brought us several
thousand candidates that filled out online applications for intent to
participate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also we found several Host
Families willing to host students for different extended periods of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Continued Development
and Marketing<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The initial group that came was very difficult and took a
lot of investment and trial by error, but overall it was very successful.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Students were escorted to the Airport by my
partner in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and greeted by me, a Japanese speaking employee, and their respective host
families in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For a month we tested what was needed and how
to proceed with future clients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the trial period we were very confident in how to run
our operation and began to process the waiting list that had developed over the
months of promotion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were now listed
as high as 3<sup>rd</sup> on all the major search engines for keywords such as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>“English” “Homestay” “Hosting” “English Schools”
</i>and a wide variety of keywords related to our business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Addition we now implemented our Customer satisfaction
promotion with document and video taped sessions of our satisfied clients
during the trial period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>ISP production<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over a Three year period ISP international grew with hard
work and personal investment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were
now promoting Colleges and even vacation/tour packages for Japanese students as
well as several other students in many different countries.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had a waiting list that was very large and
almost overwhelming.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had hired up to 5
additional consultants and translators during my time with the business and
worked just as hard with continued marketing on the website as well as person
to person promotion with host families which I chose to personally interview
before allowing them to host one of my clients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over three years I maintained the business and website doing
everything from teaching English to escorting students to places such as <st1:place>Disneyland</st1:place>
and the <st1:place>Grand Canyon</st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Fate of ISP<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After nearly three years of working hard everyday with my
new found success I was offered a buy out by an English school in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
who wanted to run the business for themselves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After much consideration I took their offer and turned the entire
business over to them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This for me was
something that I had to do since I must never have had a break in the 3 years I
ran the company and my desire to do something different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I decided to return to School moving to <st1:City><st1:place>San
  Diego</st1:place></st1:City> in 2001.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>ISP International has since been dissolved due to what I believe is a
lack of commitment on the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
side of the new business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ispint.com is
no longer online, but was reorganized to some point at <a
href="www.oeschool.com">www.oeschool.com</a> which now solely based in Japan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you do a search on Google.com for ispint.com you can
still see some of the remaining links that are still present from a company
that died out 2 ½ years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Epilogue<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was sad for me to see all of my hard work disappear after
I chose to turn it over to another organization, but at the same time I am very
relieved that I have time now to do things that I have always wanted to
do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the most precious things that
came out of the experience is that I was able to meet my wife.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She had posted messages on my site and later
I hired her as an employee to do Japanese translation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is my hope that I can take this experience
and use it in future projects that I have plans for related to Web Marketing
and business promotion. <o:p></o:p></p>
